The idea came from my own experience.

My PC crashed unexpectedly last weekend and my homework was inside it. I was in a hurry so I tried to fix it and wasted a lot of time.

In the end, I decided to send my computer to the repair shop. However, it was raining outside then and I could not take my computer and umbrella at the same time, so I could only take a taxi . 

To my disappointment, it cost me 300 dollar on taking taxi, but I just spent 800 dollar on  repairing my computer.

The whole process took me a lot of time and 1100 dollar with my body wet. It was not a good experience.
