Project title: Broken electric appliance transport service 

Description: 
Broken electric appliance transport service is designed as a service over the top of the Taiwan post office network. 
The project helps customers to get their broken electronics fixed at home. 
For one who don't have their own car or live in remote area, it's a convenient service that they don't need to go out for the fixing problem. 
The project is designed in UML and implemented in C++. 

Team members:
We are team 11, our group memebers are as follows:

Instructor: Dr. Hareesh, National Tsing Hua University.

The project is organized in the following folders:

1. Ideation 
The Idea just come from our own experience so we think the service is needed.
We have made a complete introduce in the folder "Ideation".

2. Uml design
The UML design made the whole process more clearly and we find out many problems when drawing UML, like "How do we do if the repair shop can't fix it" and 
"If the product was broken cause by the transport, is there any compensation ?"

3. Final project presentation
We use C++ because we are confident about our C++ ability
Many people are lazy in this generation so we think our service will be very popular if it can realize some day.

4. Demonstration video
The video will show you how to use our program. 

5. Code
We use C++ in our project, 
You must use C++11 to compile the code.
The sheet that customer filled is store in the same path with the code.

6. Bugs and future improvements
In the real world, we think that it's a big problem for "planning route". Because we don't know how many people want to use our service and when they need, so
everytime when a work was added, the route should be changed and it would cost a lot of resource. In the future, we should focus more on the problen like how to
plan a route, but we can't do it right now because our ability is not good enough.

If the customer say his/her product was not fixed after the product fixed by repair shop, customer can call the repair shop phone number, and tell according the sheet number,
the repair shop will have a communication with the customer to solve the problem.
